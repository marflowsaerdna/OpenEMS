*Note:* In my LDAP the memberOf overlay is installed. It creates and updates the memberOf attribute automatically. If you do not have this overlay (which is the default), you need to maintain this attribute on your own, meaning you have to add and maintain it by hand.

I have been running my LDAP for ages, but afaik memberOf overlay is deprecated for some time now. Unfortunately I did not have time to think of alternatives yet ... dynlist overlay might be a good try.
